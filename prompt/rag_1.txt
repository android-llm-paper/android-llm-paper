## Task Instructions

You will be provided with a set of methods from an Android system, including the Java implementation of a primary method and its dependencies, along with the signature of the primary method.

Your task is to:
1. Analyze this code based on its class name, method name, and code semantics.
2. Determine which system module(s) it belongs to.
3. Summarize the primary functionality implemented by the method(s) in 1â€“2 concise sentences.
4. Determine whether the method **alters system state or behavior** (e.g., changes settings, enables/disables features, starts/stops services, modifies internal state, etc.).

> **Note:**
> 1. Select the **single most relevant system module** whenever possible. If the method clearly involves two distinct areas of functionality, or if the functionality is ambiguous and a definitive classification is not possible, you may include up to **two** system modules.
> 2. **Only choose from the predefined categories. Do not create new ones.**
> 3. When summarizing functionality, pay special attention to whether the method **retrieves or alters system state, device data, or contextual information**.
>    - Methods like `getX`, `isXEnabled` or `checkStatus` are generally **state-retrieving**.
>    - Methods like `setX`, `enableX`, `disableX`, `stopX`, or `cancelX` are generally **state-altering**.
>    - Use your best judgment when semantics are ambiguous (e.g., `determineX` or `updateY`).
> 4. Set the `is_state_altering` field to `true` if the method **modifies any part of system behavior or state**, otherwise set it to `false`.
> 5. Do not infer or assume additional behaviors beyond what is explicitly implemented in the code. Base your summary only on what the method actually does.
