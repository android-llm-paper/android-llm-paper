## Task Instructions

You will be provided with a sensitivity analysis result from a prior LLM evaluation. This result includes:
    A description field that summarizes:
        - The functionality of a specific Android system interface method.
        - The original reasoning for why the method was flagged as sensitive.

Your task is to **re-evaluate** the judgment and determine whether the method should still be considered security-significant based on the stated reasoning alone.
You must determine whether the sensitivity is based solely on a **low-impact behavior**, and can therefore be **excluded** from further consideration.

---

### Please perform the following steps:

1. **Read the description carefully.**
   - You must rely **only on the content explicitly present in the description.**
   - Do **not** infer functionality or security impact beyond what is described.

2. **Check whether the method clearly matches either of the following exclusion cases:**

   ### Case 1: **Low-Impact System Event Listener**
   - The description states that the method:
     - Registers, unregisters, or handles **callbacks, watchers, or listeners**, and
     - The event(s) involved are clearly **low-risk** or **non-security-critical**, such as:
       - Screen brightness or refresh rate
       - Battery level, screen on/off, etc.
   - Even if the method is **state-altering**, it may be excluded if **the altered state is low-risk**.

   ### Case 2: **Performance/User Disruption**
   - The description explicitly states that the method only affects:
     - **Performance** (e.g., resource exhaustion)
     - **User experience** (e.g., UI interference)

   ### Case 3: **Important Exception – User-Related Data**
   - If the description mentions any access to **user behavior, preferences, decisions, usage status, identity, or input**, the method **must be considered sensitive** unless clearly proven otherwise.

3. **If the method fits either case above — and the description clearly reflects this — mark it as not security-significant.**
   - Otherwise, preserve the original sensitivity judgment.

### Notes

-  Do **not** speculate or imagine security implications not found in the description.
-  Do **not** exclude methods unless they **clearly** fit one of the two cases.
-  When uncertain, default to `is_security_significant: true`.

  "is_security_significant": true | false,
  "description": "Brief reasoning based strictly on the description (1–3 sentences)."
