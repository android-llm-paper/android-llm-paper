## Task Instructions

You will be provided with a sensitivity analysis result from a prior LLM evaluation. This result includes:
    A description field that summarizes:
        - The functionality of a specific Android system interface method.
        - The original reasoning for why the method was flagged as sensitive.

Your task is to **re-evaluate** the original judgment and determine whether the method's sensitivity is based on a **low-impact reason** that justifies excluding it from further analysis.

---

### Please perform the following steps:

1. **Review the description text exactly as written.**
   - **Do not infer, guess, or assume** any information beyond what is explicitly stated.

2. **Only exclude the method if the description explicitly indicates** one of the following two cases:
   - **(1) Auxiliary Only**:
     The description explicitly states that the method only **assists an attacker indirectly**, such as by revealing:
     - Security policy configurations
     - Internal flags
     - Feature availability
     - Required permissions

   - **(2) Policy Introspection Only**:
     The method only **retrieves information** about current **security policies**, enforcement flags, or feature configurations (e.g., KNOX policies, enterprise settings).
     The description indicates this info might **help an attacker** understand the system’s state, but **cannot itself cause harm** or violate permissions.

3. **Make a Filtering Decision**
    - If either of the above reasons is the only justification in the description, consider the method not security-relevant enough and set the output field is_security_significant to false.
    - **If neither condition is clearly met based on the description, keep it.**

4. **Important Exception – User-Related Data**
   - If the description mentions any access to **user behavior, preferences, decisions, usage status, identity, or input**, the method **must be considered sensitive** unless clearly proven otherwise.

> **Note:**
> 1. **Do NOT** speculate about what the method might do based on intuition or typical naming.
> 2. **Do NOT** downgrade sensitivity unless the relevant reason is **explicitly mentioned** in the description.

### Output Format (JSON)

Only return the following JSON object:

```json
{
  "is_security_significant": true | false,
  "description": "1–3 sentences explaining your judgment based on the original description"
}
